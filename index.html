    <p> Camels are mammals with long legs, a big-lipped snout and a humped back.
         There are two types of camels: dromedary camels, which have one hump, 
         and Bactrian camels, which have two humps. 
         Camels' humps consist of stored fat, which they can metabolize when food and water is scarce.</p>

         These colorful lizards are known as one of the few animals that can change skin color.
          However, it is a misconception that chameleons change colors to match their surroundings</p>

         All pigeons strut about with a characteristic bobbing of the head.
